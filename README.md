# Analyse the simulation data of Vicsek Model

## Multiple bands

Study how order parameters change with increasing bands. The simulations are performed on a serials of rectangle domains with fixed Ly but incresing Ly. 

## Susceptibility

Calculate sample-averaged susceptibility for varied epsilon at given system size, where we can estimate the susceptibility peak chi_m and location epsilon_m. The given system size can be regarded as the correlation length at epsilon_m.

Meanwhile, we can evaluate the correlation length form decaying of order parameters or spatial correlation functions.

## 2D Spatial correlation function

Calculate 2d spatial correlatin function of density and velocity.

Before reaches the steady state, it is of interest to study ordering dynamics.
